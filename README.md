# This ReadMe is designed to help with planning Fridgebot

## Vision (Why am I building this?)

To test and grow my knowledge of databases, by creating an app which monitors food in/out of fridge by user profile.

## Goals (Personal)

- I want to practice commiting to GitHub often
- Practice writing/utilising ReadMe's
- Use databases to generate user profiles
- Express setup, routes and db functions, using SQL query builder Knex

## User Stories (Users)

1. As a user I want to be able to see my profile on the homepage
2. Users should be able to click on there name link which takes them to there profile with details about items in fridge
3. As a user I would like the ability to add more items/delete items
4. Users should be able to create a profile

## Todos

- [x] Write the ReadMe
- [ ] Commit to GitHub often

## Reflections & Learnings

- To come..
